# periodic/elm-csv

CSV parser in Elm

[Generated Documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/periodic/elm-csv/latest)

This package does it's best to parse CSV files. This library does its best to support RFC 4180, however, many CSV inputs do not strictly follow the standard, so some accomodations have been made to make it a little more relaxed.

There's nothing fancy going on here in regards to things like auto-detection of separators or line endings. Always be careful when dealing with files in different formats.

Please submit patches, updates and fixes! This library is open to improvements to make it more versatile and functional, though it does not aim to expand beyond CSV (or possibly TSV) files.
